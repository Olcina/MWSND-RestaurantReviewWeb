## Installing the libraries

To install the project, both, the client and the server should be installed.

cd "REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY"

yarn install

cd server

yarn install 
```

## Setting up the project for development

Likewise, the client and server should be started.

``` sh
cd "REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY"

yarn gulp

cd server

yarn start
```

## Project end point

After these steps you will find the client running in your browser under the following address:
